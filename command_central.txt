# identify the RBPs having binding preference to the genome
## done by rajneesh

# intensity of motifs across the genome
## get frequency of rbs
use 1.Finding_frequency_RBPs.py file
use 2.plotting_top_RBP_frequency.R

## plot bar plot
use 1.plotting_RBP_frequency.R to plot all RBP frequency

## plot heatmap

## pick top RBPs

# intensity of these RBPs across human tissues
## top RBP expression across tissues in GTEx

# which human RNAs do these RBPs bind to?
##########################################

1. which miRNAs can bind to the genome
- run targetscan on coivd genome

2. identify the top miRNAs, functions
- quantify the motif occurence or frequency
- functional annotation?

3. abundance of these miRNAs in different human cells
- GTEx data, abundance extraction for top miRNAs
- visulalize
